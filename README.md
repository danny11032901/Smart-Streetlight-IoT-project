# IoT-Project
The Smart Street Light project aims to create an energy-efficient and intelligent lighting system using Arduino Uno and sensors. The setup uses ambient light sensors to adjust brightness based on natural light and motion sensors to detect pedestrians or vehicles. When movement is detected, the lights automatically brighten to ensure safety. In the absence of motion, the lights dim or turn off to conserve energy. This adaptive lighting approach reduces electricity consumption and operational costs. The system also supports real-time decision-making through sensor data processing. It contributes to sustainable development by reducing carbon emissions and minimizing light pollution. Smart street lights can further integrate with smart city infrastructure like traffic management and environmental monitoring. The project demonstrates how IoT-based automation can improve safety, efficiency, and urban living standards.
